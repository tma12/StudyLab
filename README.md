StudyLab
========

An app featuring an extensive and well-organized archive of academic exercises that are written, edited, polished, and studied by students and mentors from anywhere.
Emphasis is given on readability, clarity, ease-of-use, and quick loading times for exercises featured in the archive.
The mechanics for creating and revising study problems works similar to that of doing the same with repositories on Git/GitHub. Studying exercises on StudyLab works just as you would expect on any site, except it recommends new problems based on your responses to previous problems.
